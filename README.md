Design Styleguide
=================

So you've designed something. That's really cool, but, how is it going to get built? PDF styleguides are so 2012, and well, it's 2013.

**Welcome to the future.**

###Let's get started

This tool, and by relation the styleguide, is super simple. It's going to generate a couple sections, a section for developer resources, and all the CSS and JS you need to get started. And you thought this was going to be hard.

Once you have your styleguide (which is packaged into a beautiful zip file, you're welcome), place it somewhere on your computer or a server and view it in a web browser. Need help? Stand up and ask, "Who knows HTML and CSS?" and I'm sure someone will come walking over.
